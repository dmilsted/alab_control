Each of the Position files contain positioning information for the printer head and bed for various tasks as described below.

== Sample holders ==
These files contain the positioning information that match each position inside a tray or the Phenom stage, and also some Z positions that are used to pick
and place the holders with different speeds, allowing a more accurate and safe operation.
Clean SEM stubs and TEM grids positions are listed in the files:
- Stubs_tray.csv
- Disks_tray_clean.csv

While exposed/used SEM stubs and TEM grids positions are listed in the files:
- Disks_tray_used.csv
- Phenom_stubs.csv
Obs: the user might request that a SEM stub goes back to the tray. In that case, obviously, the tray would hold a not-clean stub.

== Equipment and Safe Operation ==
These files contain important positioning information that allow the machine to operate safely and to use its internal pieces (equipment):
- Equipment.csv
- Intermediate_positions.csv
Some equipment need the head to stay in a "home" position for that specific equipment. They are called intermediate positions and are used
for safe operation since the machine should not move the bed while the head is low. Each equipment might have many Z positions to operate safely,
as they allow the usage of different speeds to accomplish a task more safely and/or accurately. Regarding material receipt and delivery, the
machine needs to extend the bed to receive and deliver materials and samples, and this movement can only happen with the head z-homed.


The file "phenom_handler.csv"  might not be necessary and its exclusion is being considered.
